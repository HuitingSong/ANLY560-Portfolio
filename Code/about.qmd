# Hello from Huiting Song

First of all, Welcome to my website :)

I am a graduate student in the Data Science and Analytics program at Georgetown University. This is my third trip to Washington, DC. The first time I went, I lost my new phone on the streets of Georgetown. The purpose of my visit was to see the cherry blossoms, however, they were not in full bloom during my spring break. So, I called this place "unfortunate Washington". I went here for the second time to celebrate Chinese Lunar New Year with my family, and that's when I told myself that I was going to apply to a graduate program in Washington, DC. This place gives me the feeling of peace, safety and comfort. I love the clean streets, the cultural atmosphere, and the attitude of openness. This is now my third time here. Not for the sakura, not for my leisure time, but for my graduate studies. I think I will love this place even more because I will make new friends, learn new things, and have a new direction in life here. I'm looking forward to my new life in the DSAN program, Georgetown University, and Washington.

My undergraduate degree was at the University of Connecticut, which is a very beautiful campus with over 20,000 people. The picture above was taken when I graduated, next to the school mascot, Johnathan, and I was an economics and statistics double major with a math minor. It sounds awesome, but the truth is you don't want to experience the feeling of being surrounded by formulas and numbers in your head every day, or even going to bed thinking about how to write this math problem or how to analyze that economic trend in your head. At UConn, I met the professor who inspired me to study data analysis. He taught me how to do statistical analysis and encouraged me to try more analytical skills, and even worked with me to pick a graduate program in data analysis. I am happy to have met her during this four-year journey.

Besides studying, I will arrange different things for myself to enrich my life. My favorite thing is K-pop dancing. When I was in junior high school, around 13 years old, Korean entertainment culture started to take over the Chinese entertainment market. That's when I began to enjoy watching Korean idol groups and Korean drama. I would schedule time for myself to go to the dance studio every week, which not only gave me physical exercise, but also made me feel energetic.

Other than that, I love to travel, especially with my friends. Every time I go to a place, I will take a lot of photos as a souvenir. Because I don't know when I will travel to this place again, I try to experience the local culture and relax myself as much as possible on every trip. My most impressive trip so far is that of Thanksgiving 2019 in Puerto Rico. My friends and I were boating on the lake that night and I accidentally looked up and saw the most beautiful starry sky I've ever seen in my life. Unfortunately, I couldn't record it with my phone, but the starry sky is enough to keep in my mind forever.

If you like K-pop dancing and traveling, I think we will be the good friend. Well, That is all for "About Me". Hoping you enjoy my self-introduction.
